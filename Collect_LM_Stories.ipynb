We focus specifically on work, school, and personal life roles that vary in power, access, and representation. In each case, we look at not only how these roles are represented as standalone subjects, but how the compositions of these roles change when we introduce power dynamics.\n","\n","For example, in the school condition, we may ask the models to generate a standalone story of a \"student who excels in history class\". We can then examine how these responses differ when we ask the models to introduce a power dynamic - e.g. a \"star student who mentors a struggling student in history class\". In the resulting stories, how are the dominant and subordinate characters represented? And what does that reveal about what statistical associations the models have made to race/racism, gender/sexism, nationality/nationalism, and class/classism?\n","\n","Stores the results in Excel
